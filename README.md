 Developed a mathematically rigorous feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy, implementing complete forward/backward propagation with He initialization and L2 regularization. Achieved 97.37% test accuracy on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, validating theoretical derivations against scikit-learn's MLPClassifier. Demonstrated expertise in multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and gradient-based optimization through comprehensive experimental analysis.
